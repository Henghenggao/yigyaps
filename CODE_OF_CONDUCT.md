# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in the YigYaps project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

**Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:**

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

**Examples of unacceptable behavior:**

- Harassment, insults, or derogatory comments, whether public or private
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Trolling or deliberately disruptive conduct
- Contributions that exploit creators or harm the community
- Any conduct that would be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies in all project spaces — GitHub issues, pull requests, discussions, and any other community forums — and also applies when an individual is representing the project in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by opening an issue at https://github.com/Henghenggao/yigyaps/issues with the label `conduct`. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 2.1.
